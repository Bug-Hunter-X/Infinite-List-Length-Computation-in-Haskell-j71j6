This Haskell code attempts to use the `length` function on an infinite list, which leads to a non-terminating computation.  The program will run indefinitely without producing any output or reaching a conclusion. 
```haskell
import Prelude hiding (length)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let infiniteList = [1..] 
  let listLength = length infiniteList
  print listLength
```
